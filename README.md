# [OpenWeather API](dkallen78.github.io/openweather-api/weatherAPI.html)

This is my first use of an API and it turns out that getting the data was the easy part. The real trick, it seems to me, is presenting the data you get in a clean and useful manner. 

In future updates I want to make use of sunrise/sunset times to change the background color, possibly incorporating weather as well.

The next step is incorporating this into a custom homepage for Firefox.
